# 🛰️ Moonrider Identity Reconciliation System

A Spring Boot-based web service that solves the **"Identity Reconciliation"** challenge for **Moonrider x Zamazon** by linking customer identities that use different emails and phone numbers for each order — inspired by the curious case of **Doc Chandrashekar** and his time-travel adventures.

### 🎯 Goal

1. Build an `/identify` endpoint to accept contact data.
2. Detect overlaps across purchases using email/phone.
3. Maintain a **linked chain** of contact records.
4. Respond with a complete, **merged identity** that includes:
    - `primaryContactId`
    - All known `emails`
    - All known `phoneNumbers`
    - List of `secondaryContactIds`

## ⚙️ API Endpoint

### 🔹 POST `/identify`

#### 📥 Request:

```json
{
  "email": "doc@brown.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210"
}
📌 Business Logic Summary
If no existing contact is found → create a new PRIMARY contact.

If a match is found on email or phone, and new info is introduced → create a SECONDARY contact linked to the oldest PRIMARY.

If both email and phone exist in different primaries, the later one becomes a SECONDARY and links to the older one — consolidation happens.

All linked contacts (primary + secondary) are returned in the response.

✅ How to Run the Project Locally
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Java 17+ (Java 22 preferred)

MySQL installed locally

IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code (optional)

Maven

2️⃣ Clone This Repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/identity-reconciliation-service.git
cd identity-reconciliation-service
3️⃣ Create MySQL Database
sql
CREATE DATABASE contact_db;
4️⃣ Update application.properties
In src/main/resources/application.properties:

properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/contact_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
5️⃣ Run the App
Using terminal:


./mvnw spring-boot:run
Or from IntelliJ:

Open DemoApplication.java

Click ▶️ Run

🧪 Postman Testing Guide
🔹 Test Case 1: New contact
json
{
  "email": "doc@future.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9999999999"
}
➡️ Creates a new PRIMARY.

🔹 Test Case 2: Same email, new phone
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "email": "doc@future.com",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
}
➡️ Adds SECONDARY with new phone, linked to original contact.

🔹 Test Case 3: Same phone, different email
json
{
  "email": "flux@capacitor.com",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
}
➡️ Adds SECONDARY again if email wasn't known.

🔹 Test Case 4: Email + Phone that exist in different primaries
➡️ Merge both under the older PRIMARY, adjust linkedId and linkPrecedence.

❌ Invalid Case
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "email": null,
  "phoneNumber": null
}
